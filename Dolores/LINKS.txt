Just found a software for creating a pattern according to your own measurements:
http://www.golden-pattern.online.de/
I didn't try it out - so I don't know how similar it is to our program.

Then a webpage with some links to pages with free patterns:
http://www.amenita.de/partner-familie/freizeit/kostenlose-schnittmuster-in-huelle-und-fuelle-zum-herunterladen/

Thought that could be useful for our project!
